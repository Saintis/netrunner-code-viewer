# Netrunner Code Viewer

The intention of this project is to make the [jinteki.net](http://jinteki.net) [code base](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner) easier to explore.

## Current Coverage

Currently only the code snippets specific to cards are available to browsing.

## Usage

Run the python scripts to generate markdown pages for each card type, and the data used to populate the pages.

Alternatively run the Makefile with `make`. This will run all the python scripts automatically (and in the correct order).

Run the jekyll server as described on the [Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).
